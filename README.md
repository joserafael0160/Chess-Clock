# Chess-Clock

The chess clock I‚Äôve developed is a web application that allows players to manage their time during a chess match. When time runs out, the clock emits a sound alarm to alert the players. Additionally, players can select different time durations, such as 10 minutes, 5 minutes, etc. 

I‚Äôve also incorporated the functionality to add additional time during the game, similar to traditional chess clocks. 

In summary, this project combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a functional and user-friendly chess clock. üï∞Ô∏èüëë
